        <h2>CocaCola</h2>
        <p>
          The Coca-Cola Company started operating in India in 1950. However, in
          1977, they withdrew operations from the country in protest of
          regulations and legislation by the Government of India limiting the
          dilution of equity of multinational corporations. On October 24, 1993,
          they decided to re-enter the market, and have maintained a strong
          presence ever since.

        <h2>Sprite</h2>
        <p>
          By the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among
          teenagers.[3] In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic
          in their advertisements in 1987. "I Like the Sprite In You" was the
          brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced
          around it before its discontinuation in 1994.
